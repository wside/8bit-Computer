* original ISA design (see [documentation](https://github.com/wside/8bit-Computer/blob/master/Documentation/Documentation.pdf)) 
* original assembler  
#    
* can write simple programs based on ISA and assembler  
* can manually load programs by saving machine code in instrmem.list file 
#    
* "hardware" written in behavioral-level Verilog   
* see computer [layout diagram](https://github.com/wside/8bit-Computer/blob/master/Documentation/8bit-Layout1.pdf)
